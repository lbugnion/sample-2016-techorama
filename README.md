# Abstract

Windows Presentation Foundation is what people are using to build real applications for the enterprise, the industry, the workplace, and for every situation where Windows 10 Universal is not quite ready yet. Far from being dead, WPF is 10 years old this year, alive and kicking, and gives Universal Applications a run for their money! In this session, Laurent Bugnion, a Microsoft Windows Developer MVP and Microsoft Regional Director, WPF expert since 2006, will show you what is new in Windows Presentation Foundation, where it is going in the future, and what you can achieve with WPF that Universal Application developers can only dream of.
